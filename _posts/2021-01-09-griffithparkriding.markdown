A trip to Griffith Park. We parked in the lot by the Merry Go Round but closer to the playgrounds. It was pretty crowded by the time we got there. Stacy and Quincy went up the trail that we usually take and Harriet and I rode towards Mt. Hollywood. We all met up at the picnic table. It was almost perfect timing at the top. After a quick lunch Stacy went the long way back and we went to the Observatory. On the way back we went through the tunnel.

"That was a great sound!"

You fell asleep on the ride back so I had to slowly and carefully go back. Again, we all met back at the almost the same exact time.
